Map21 is an example of how to create a map using my system
load it up in Tiled to see how it functions

the compiler works by finding the names of the layers, if it cant find the names then it will just grab the layers in order
so the layers can have there names changed if you want but the layers possition must be absoulte: ie what you see in the example

once you are finished creating the map, export as a json file
then feed it into the compiler, it will turn it into the format we need and it can be added to the map folder in spirit quest


RIGHT NOW:
the fence is the only thing that works on the object and top layer(layer 1 and layer 2) we can make some sprite sheets later
